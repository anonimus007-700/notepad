<h1 align="center">This program is developed in python to encode text into a multi-step code:scream:</h1>

First, install the necessary modules `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Or simply open the `main.exe` file in the `exe` folder. In this case, you do not have to install additional libraries.

examples of the final coding can be seen in the `test` folder.:+1:
